# caelestia-fuzzel

Fuzzel config for my caelestia dotfiles.
This is mostly for colour scheme switching.

## Installation

Use the `install.fish` script in the base of the repo.

## Usage

If `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your path, just use the `fuzzel` command as normal.
Otherwise, use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuzzel/run.fish`.
